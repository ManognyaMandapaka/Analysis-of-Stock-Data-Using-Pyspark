There are 3 parts to this analysis:

--> In the process of analyzing blockchain data using Apache Spark and PySpark, several challenges and resolutions were encountered. Initially, the data was loaded into Spark DataFrames from an HDFS location, and a Unicode-related error emerged during schema inference. This error was resolved by ensuring consistent data types in each column and explicitly specifying the schema when creating the DataFrame. Additionally, various code snippets were provided to address Python 2 compatibility issues and demonstrate tasks such as finding the total number of blocks, determining the largest block height, extracting the date and time for the largest block, and identifying the highest number of transactions in the blocks. These tasks involved employing Spark RDDs and Spark SQL, leveraging their operations to derive meaningful insights from the blockchain dataset. The procedure highlighted the importance of data consistency, schema specification, and clean data to ensure accurate analysis within the Spark environment.

--> In this analysis, we utilized Apache Spark and its Spark SQL module to examine and summarize data stored in MySQL databases as part of a previous project. The data was organized into three tables: blocks, blocks_info, and tx_info. Leveraging PySpark's SQL capabilities, we addressed several queries to extract key insights. First, we determined the total number of blocks present in the blocks table, finding that there were a total of 807,290 blocks. Next, we identified the block with the highest height, discovering it to be the block with a height of 807,290. Further analysis of the blocks_info table revealed that this block's timestamp was associated with a specific date and time. Finally, we investigated the maximum number of transactions within the blocks, uncovering that this block had the largest number of transactions. This procedure showcases the power of Spark SQL in efficiently querying and analyzing data directly from MySQL databases, providing valuable insights into the characteristics of the blockchain dataset.

--> In the given Spark SQL analysis, we employed PySpark to analyze a dataset stored on HDFS. The dataset consisted of stock market data with columns such as Symbol, Timestamp, Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume. Utilizing Spark SQL and DataFrames, we performed various analyses on the dataset. First, we determined the total number of records in the table, followed by identifying the distinct days recorded in the dataset. Further, we calculated the count of records for each day, identified the unique symbols present, and computed the highest, lowest, and average prices for each symbol. Additionally, we determined the price range for each symbol. Finally, we identified the dates on which each symbol experienced the highest price. Throughout this analysis, we encountered and addressed several challenges, such as resolving column naming issues in Spark SQL queries and handling data type inconsistencies. The findings provide valuable insights into the stock market data, showcasing patterns and trends specific to each symbol over different days.
